# VowelMeter

VowelMeter is a free program for semi-automatic placement of vowel articulations in the IPA Vowel Diagram. It uses neural network models trained on articulations of Cardinal Vowels by 14 phoneticians.

The functionality of VowelMeter is divided into two parts:

1. In the first part, the user performs an acoustic analysis of a given vowel, resulting in the values of F0 and the first three formants.

2. In the second part, these measurements are used for automatic placement in the IPA Vowel Diagram.

VowelMeter is available for free at [vowelmeter.pythonanywhere.com](https://vowelmeter.pythonanywhere.com). Additionally, you can find the machine learning scripts used for this project at [github.com/Stolarski-Lukasz/ML_Projects](https://github.com/Stolarski-Lukasz/ML_Projects) and the voice analysis scripts used for obtaining acoustic measurements at [github.com/Stolarski-Lukasz/audio_analysis](https://github.com/Stolarski-Lukasz/audio_analysis).
